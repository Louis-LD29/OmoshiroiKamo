# ⚙️ Omoshiroi Kamo [Minecraft 1.7.10]

A Minecraft mod for 1.7.10 that adds scientifically-grounded materials, physical properties, and technology
integration — with a focus on real-world physics and chemistry.

## 🔬 Vision

- Unlike most Minecraft mods that abstract or simplify mechanics, this mod aims to model real physical and chemical
  properties — including density, thermal conductivity, specific heat, melting point, pressure resistance, and
  electrical
  conductivity — for each material.

- Whether you're building with titanium alloys or designing energy systems with copper and silver wires, the numbers you
  see are grounded in actual engineering principles.

## 🔧 Features

- Compatibility with **Tinkers' Construct** cast systems

## 🧩 Integrations / Backports

- Sophisticated Backpacks (Backport)

- Environmental Tech (Backport)

## 📦 Credits
